## Part 1 Notes

**Q: What is Functional Programming**?
_A: It's a programming technique that avoids side-effects in one's programs by performing computation mainly through evaluation of (mathematical) functions and relies heavily on immutable data structures._

_Another advantage of using this paradigm is the potential of reducing the number of bugs in one's program and potentially make them more maintainable_

Example Dataset: 
```
| Name         | Field     | Year of Birth | Nobel Prize? |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Ada Lovelace | Math      | 1815          | No           |
| Emmy Noether | Math      | 1882          | No           |
| Marie Curie  | Physics   | 1867          | Yes          |
| Tu Youyou    | Chemistry | 1930          | Yes          |
| Ada Yonath   | Chemistry | 1939          | Yes          |
| Vera Rubin   | Astronomy | 1928          | No           |
| Sally Ride   | Physics   | 1951          | No           |

**Q: How do we represent different data sets using Functional Programming styles (a.k.a. Immutable Data Structures)**?
_A: Using Named Tuples, which are immutable (something like objects, but its properties cannot be modified)._


- Immutable data structures lead to cleaner conceptual models and makes it easy to come up with the calculations performed on the immutable data structure (i.e. "see" the history)
